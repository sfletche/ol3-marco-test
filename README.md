==============

Testing out some MARCO features in OpenLayers 3

Features to Test include
* basic map with base layer, vector layer, xyz layer, and wms (arcrest) layer
 * Basemaps 
    * ESRI Ocean (experiment with original ESRI Ocean Basemap Layer and new version)
    * Other ESRI Layers - http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline/maps/maps-and-map-layers 
    * Others? 
 * Vector Layer - Submarine Canyons (from portal) with Mouseover and Click interaction
 * Vector Layer with a very large number of vertices
 * XYZ Layer - 
 * WMS Layer (ESRI) - 
 * WMS Layer (OGC) - 

Left column for table of contents (activating/deactivating layers)?
Right column for basemap options?
